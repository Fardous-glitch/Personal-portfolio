# Portfolio Setup

## Required Files

To complete your portfolio setup, add these files to your project directory:

### 1. Profile Image
- **File name**: `profile.jpg`
- **Recommended size**: 400x400px or larger (square aspect ratio)
- **Format**: JPG, PNG, or WebP
- **Description**: Your professional headshot or profile photo

### 2. CV/Resume
- **File name**: `cv.pdf`
- **Format**: PDF
- **Description**: Your current CV/resume that visitors can download

## Features Added

✅ **Dark/Light Mode Toggle**: Click the theme button in the navigation to switch between dark and light modes. Your preference is saved automatically.

✅ **Profile Image**: Replace the text avatar with your actual photo. If the image fails to load, it falls back to text initials.

✅ **CV Download**: Added a "Download CV" button in the hero section that allows visitors to download your resume.

## Usage

1. Add your `profile.jpg` image to the project folder
2. Add your `cv.pdf` file to the project folder  
3. The portfolio will automatically use these files

If you don't have these files yet, the portfolio will still work with fallbacks (text avatar and the download button will show but won't work until you add the CV file).
